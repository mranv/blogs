## About
Congratulations! You've stumbled upon the repository where my profound thoughts and questionable humor collide in a spectacular display of digital chaos. Here, you'll find a treasure trove of blog posts that will either leave you in stitches or scratching your head in confusion. Either way, buckle up for a wild ride!

## Contents
- **.husky**: Not just your average canine companion, but the guardian of this chaotic circus.
- **.vscode**: Where VSCode settings reside, because even blogs need their own workspace.
- **public**: Dive into the madness of my blog posts. Proceed with caution; side effects may include uncontrollable laughter.
- **src**: The source of all things witty... or just a glimpse into my caffeine-fueled mind.
- **.eslintignore**: Ignoring linting rules like they're yesterday's news. We prefer our code with a hint of rebellion.
- **.eslintrc.js**: Setting rules because apparently, chaos needs structure too.
- **.gitignore**: Ignoring responsibilities since... well, forever. Who needs deadlines when you have memes?
- **.markdownlint.json**: Keeping markdown in check because even chaos has its limits.
- **.npmrc**: A mystical incantation to summon npm packages. Abracadabra, I guess?
- **.prettierignore**: Ignoring prettier because beauty is in the eye of the beer holder... I mean, beholder.
- **.prettierrc**: Making code pretty because we're all about that superficial charm.
- **astro.config.ts**: Aligning the stars to predict when our next blog post will go viral. Spoiler alert: probably never.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Dockerizing our blogs because why not add another layer of complexity?
- **package-lock.json**: Locking packages like they're prisoners. Stay in your cells, npm dependencies!
- **package.json**: The master plan... or maybe just a list of dependencies disguised as ambition.
- **remark-collapse.d.ts**: Collapsing remarks because who has time for constructive feedback?
- **tailwind.config.cjs**: Configuring tailwind because we like to ride the winds of change... or at least our CSS does.
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configurations because we're too cool for plain JavaScript.
