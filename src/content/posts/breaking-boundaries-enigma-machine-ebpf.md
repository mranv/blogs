# Breaking Boundaries: Implementing the Enigma Machine in eBPF

Today we are marking the celebration of Alan Turing's 113th birthday by implementing the Enigma machine in eBPF. The Enigma machine was not developed by Turing himself, but it was the machine he famously broke during World War II.

## The Historical Enigma and Turing's Legacy

The Enigma machine was an encryption device developed in the early 20th century and famously used by Nazi Germany during World War II to encrypt their military communications. The machine's seemingly unbreakable encryption posed a significant challenge to the Allied forces. There were many variants of the machine, but they all shared a common design: a keyboard, a set of rotating scrambling wheels (rotors) that scrambled letters, a plugboard to scramble the letters even more, and a lampboard that displayed the encrypted output.

Alan Turing, a British mathematician and logician, played a crucial role in the British version of the Bombe machine, which was designed to break the Enigma's encrypted messages. The Bombe was specifically designed to find the daily settings, i.e., the setup of the rotors that were used during the 24 hours. After finding the daily settings, many messages could be manually decrypted. This breakthrough is estimated to have shortened World War II by two to four years, potentially saving millions of lives.

Turing's work on breaking the Enigma machine laid foundational principles for modern computing and artificial intelligence. His concepts of computation and the famous "Turing machine" established the theoretical groundwork that underpins all modern computers and algorithms.

## My Journey with eBPF: A Decade in the Making

Although I've been indirectly involved in eBPF since its beginning about 10 years ago, I personally found it practically impossible to develop using this technology due to the verifier being notoriously difficult to work with. In the early days, you'd frequently encounter cryptic errors like this monstrous output from a simple change:

```

With complexity limits of just 4,096 instructions, even simple programs would fail verification. The verifier would output thousands of lines of assembly-like instructions with register states and jump targets that made little sense to anyone except the most dedicated kernel developers. These error messages were challenging to decipher, ironically similar to the challenge of breaking an Enigma-encrypted message itself. You practically needed to be Alan Turing to make sense of what was going wrong! That's why I left eBPF to more talented engineers with deeper kernel expertise and decided to focus my efforts on Cilium's control plane, which was written in Golang.

That's why, a decade after first encountering eBPF, I decided to take on the challenge to see how much the tooling had improved, approaching it as a complete novice. What better way to test this than by implementing the very encryption machine that Turing himself worked to crack?

The first brick wall I hit was my old nemesis: the verifier, which greeted me with this "friendly" error:

```c
; unsigned int i = c - 'A'; @ prog.c:42
53: (0f) r9 += r1                     ; R1_w=scalar(smin=0,smax=umax=0xffffffff,var_off=(0x0; 0x1ffffffff))
; i = (i + *p0) % 26; @ prog.c:44
54: (07) r9 += -65                    ; R9_w=scalar(smin=0,smax=umax=0x100000018,var_off=(0x0; 0x1ffffffff))
55: (67) r9 <<= 32                    ; R9_w=scalar(smax=0x7fffffff00000000,umax=0xffffffff00000000,smin32=0,smax32=umax32=0,var_off=(0x0; 0xffffffff00000000))
56: (77) r9 >>= 32                    ; R9_w=scalar(smin=0,smax=umax=0xffffffff,var_off=(0x0; 0xffffffff))
57: (97) r9 %= 26                     ; R9_w=scalar()
; i = array[i]; @ prog.c:46
58: (18) r3 = 0xffff9d3592696f08      ; R3_w=map_value(map=prog.rodata,ks=4,vs=156)
60: (0f) r3 += r9

math between map_value pointer and register with unbounded min value is not allowed
```

The errors might look similarly cryptic, but at least they're more focused and specific now, pointing to the exact line in my source code where the problem occurred. Still, it wasn't exactly obvious what was going wrong.

Fortunately, I had the perk of being friends with the eBPF co-creator, so I simply dropped him a question: "Hey Daniel, is this a verifier bug or what?" (Of course, the problem was between the chair and the keyboard). He replied: "Ah, the compiler is optimizing away the if (i < 0 || i >= 26) return c; since it knows you did modulo." And I thought, "Great, now I have to fight against the compiler as well..." I decided to shelve it for the next day.

When I returned to the project, I discovered something that every developer loves: documentation! I'm kidding... I read up on how to use `bpf_printk`, which helped me tremendously in understanding what I was doing wrong.

After a couple of days, I successfully implemented cipher and decipher functionality for messages. By messages, I mean UDP packets that I could send and receive using `nc`. Unfortunately, I noticed my implementation wasn't matching the original Enigma, or at least not matching the results of other Enigma machine emulators I found online.

After diving into Wikipedia pages on the Enigma machine, reading countless blogs, and watching videos about its mechanics, I discovered my implementation had a subtle but critical bug. In one of the videos describing Enigma's behavior, I had assumed the rotors would rotate _after_ the electrical signal passed through them. It turns out the rotors actually rotate _before_ the electrical signal is sent. Once I fixed this subtle detail, my implementation finally matched other Enigma emulators.

This journey reminded me of Turing's own persistence when trying to decrypt Enigma messages. The modern challenges I faced with the eBPF verifier pale in comparison to what Turing and his team had to overcome with minimal resources and the pressure of war.

## The Enigma Machine in eBPF

My eBPF implementation captures all the key components of the original Enigma machine "Enigma I" with three rotors (I, II, III) from 1930 and a reflector (Reflector B).

### 1. Rotors and Reflectors

Implemented using BPF maps, these simulate the mechanical rotors that performed the encryption in the physical Enigma machine. Each rotor is essentially a scrambled alphabet - press 'A' and it might connect to 'R', while 'B' might connect to 'F':

```c
// Maps for rotors, inverse rotors, reflector, and rotor positions
struct {
    __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY);
    __uint(max_entries, 26);
    __type(key, __u32);
    __type(value, __u8);
    __uint(pinning, LIBBPF_PIN_BY_NAME);
} rotor1_map SEC(".maps"), rotor1_inv_map SEC(".maps"),
  rotor2_map SEC(".maps"), rotor2_inv_map SEC(".maps"),
  rotor3_map SEC(".maps"), rotor3_inv_map SEC(".maps"),
  reflector_map SEC(".maps");
```

### 2. Character Processing

For each character, the eBPF code simulates the electrical signal passing through the rotors, reflector, and back through the rotors - just like the physical machine:

```c
// Encrypt a single uppercase character
static __always_inline char enigma_encrypt_char(__u32 p0, __u32 p1, __u32 p2, char c) {
    if (c < 'A' || c > 'Z')
        return c;

    __u32 i = c - 'A';

    // Forward pass through the rotors
    PROCESS_ROTOR(get_rotor3, p2, i);
    PROCESS_ROTOR(get_rotor2, p1, i);
    PROCESS_ROTOR(get_rotor1, p0, i);

    // Hit the reflector
    i = get_reflector(i);

    // Backward pass through the inverse rotors
    PROCESS_ROTOR(get_rotor1_inv, p0, i);
    PROCESS_ROTOR(get_rotor2_inv, p1, i);
    PROCESS_ROTOR(get_rotor3_inv, p2, i);

    return i + 'A';
}
```

### 3. Rotor Stepping

My implementation includes the complex "double-stepping" behavior of the physical Enigma's mechanical rotors:

```c
// Step rotors just like in the real Enigma (odometer style)
static __always_inline void step_rotors() {
    // Define notch positions (example: rotor1=Q, rotor2=E, rotor3=V)
    const __u32 notch2 = 4;  // E
    const __u32 notch3 = 21; // V

    // Double-stepping logic
    if (*r1 == notch2) {
        *r0 = (*r0 + 1) % 26; // Step left rotor
        *r1 = (*r1 + 1) % 26; // Step middle rotor
    }
    if (*r2 == notch3) {
        *r1 = (*r1 + 1) % 26; // Step middle rotor
    }

    *r2 = (*r2 + 1) % 26; // Step right rotor
}
```

## Bonus: A "Not-to-be-Named Bombe" in eBPF

The Enigma machine implementation was straightforward, but as an Allied codebreaker, we also need to implement the Bombe. After researching the Bombe more deeply, I realized that implementing it in eBPF would be a significant challenge. The original Bombe wasn't designed for naive brute-force attacks, but rather for targeted searches using logical deductions based on cribs (known plaintext fragments).

Given the Bombe's complexity, I opted to implement a simplified version. Interestingly, my simplified Bombe only works on kernels 5.17 and later, as it relies on `bpf_loop()` to iterate through all possible rotor positions. This makes the code surprisingly simple while demonstrating something that would have been extraordinarily complex in earlier versions of eBPF:

```c
for (int i = 0; i <= lctx->payload_len - crib_len; i++) {
    // [...]
    if (match) {
        p0 = idx / (26 * 26);
        p1 = (idx / 26) % 26;
        p2 = (idx % 26);
        bpf_printk("Found! Run make set-rotor-position POS=%d R0=%d R1=%d R2=%d INPUT=\"<ENCRYPTED MSG>\"", i, p0, p1, p2);
        return 1; // Stop the loop
    }
}
```

With the Bombe implemented, we can now run it against the encrypted messages to find the rotor positions used for encryption. This allows us to decrypt messages by finding the position of a "crib" (a known plaintext fragment). In our example, we know the Nazis used the expression "EBPF ROCK". We don't know where it is in the message, but we can search for it. The Bombe will iterate through all possible rotor positions and check if the decrypted message contains the encrypted crib. If it finds a match, it will print the rotor positions needed to decrypt the message and the position of the crib in the message.

To decrypt the message, we can then run the Enigma machine with the found rotor positions and the position of the crib. The Enigma machine will then decrypt it.

Success! We were able to decrypt the message using the Bombe, and the Allies will have a significant advantage in winning the war!

## From Breaking Codes to Breaking Boundaries

On June 23rd, 2025, as we celebrate Alan Turing's 113th birthday and his revolutionary contributions to computing, my eBPF implementation of the Enigma machine serves as both a technical demonstration and a personal tribute to his genius.

The evolution of eBPF over the past decade, from a limited packet filter to a Turing-complete system capable of implementing complex encryption algorithms, demonstrates the same innovative spirit that Turing embodied. Today, writing eBPF programs is more accessible than ever. So much so that anyone can experiment and build even the silliest things, like an Enigma machine or something as simple as a "dumb" Bombe. What Turing accomplished with paper, pencils, and early electromechanical computers, we can now do within the Linux kernel itself.
