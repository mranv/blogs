**Scenario:**
The SOC team has recently been alerted to the potential existence of an insider threat. The suspect employee's workstation has been secured and examined. During the memory analysis, the Senior DFIR Analyst succeeded in extracting several intriguing URLs from the memory. These are now provided to you for further analysis to uncover any evidence, such as indications of data exfiltration or contact with malicious entities. Should you discover any information regarding the attacking group or individuals involved, you will collaborate closely with the threat intelligence team. Additionally, you will assist the Forensics team in creating a timeline. Warning : This Sherlock will require an element of OSINT and some answers can be found outside of the provided artifacts to complete fully.

>Task 1: When did the suspect first start Direct Message (DM) conversations with the external entity (A possible threat actor group which targets organizations by paying employees to leak sensitive data)? (UTC)

To solve this we need to use [unfurl](https://dfir.blog/unfurl/) and let it extract timestamp for us, an answer is first timestamp that was extracted

>Task 2: What was the name of the file sent to the suspected insider threat?

Its the same file we have

>Task 5: The suspect originally typed something else in search tab, but found a Google search result suggestion which they clicked on. Can you confirm which words were written in search bar by the suspect originally?
