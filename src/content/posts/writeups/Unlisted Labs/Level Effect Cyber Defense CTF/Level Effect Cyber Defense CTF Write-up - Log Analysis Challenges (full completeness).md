*NOTE*: This challenge I heavily relied on [Ultimate IT Security Windows Security Log Events Encyclopedia](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/) so I would love to share this wonderful resource to my readers here!

## Name that event 1 (100 points)
![9f0a5d9d8503e04ab0785071deafbd84.png](/assets/resources-writeups/9f0a5d9d8503e04ab0785071deafbd84.avif)
I failed to log on. What event ID am I?
***

Easy one. we can just search for "failed" on encyclopedia then we will see that when an account failed to log on, Windows will log this as EventID 4625

```
4625
```
***
## Name that event 2 (100 points)
![6e41a97c5e593e71b9de72112271e3dd.png](/assets/resources-writeups/6e41a97c5e593e71b9de72112271e3dd.avif)
I am newly scheduled. What event ID am I?
***

From this clue, we know that its related to Schedule task and "newly" mean that it just created so Windows will log this as EventID 4698

```
4698
```
***
## Name that event 3 (100 points)
![af48c369a211c8708fcaf9de542ac6bb.png](/assets/resources-writeups/af48c369a211c8708fcaf9de542ac6bb.avif)
I'm up and off to work. What event ID am I?
***
![28adeb35b6840447a3bda45b9960489f.png](/assets/resources-writeups/28adeb35b6840447a3bda45b9960489f.avif)

I was a little bit struggle on this one, at first I thought it might be Event ID 4608 (Windows is starting up) but there is another EventID that came across my mind which is new process started / created and turns out, it was the right answer

```
4688
```
***
## Name that event 4 (100 points)
![5dd0da9682ff74f6dfdc752d392d5883.png](/assets/resources-writeups/5dd0da9682ff74f6dfdc752d392d5883.avif)
I can't remember a thing. What event ID am I?
***
![ecc6f90b8a70bcc5e1f83b8e0eb52ff1.png](/assets/resources-writeups/ecc6f90b8a70bcc5e1f83b8e0eb52ff1.avif)

Can not remember a thing? possible something was cleared

```
1102
```

## whoami (100 points)
![e232157079178661c5d2dd74f27acba6.png](/assets/resources-writeups/e232157079178661c5d2dd74f27acba6.avif)
What tactic was the attacker employing based on this command history? (1 word)
***

After reviewing these commands, we can see that an attacker tried to gain information as much as possible on targeted system and this tactic called Discovery according to MITRE ATT&CK

```
Discovery
```
***
## In the system (150 points)
![ffc31aaf84a002e4dee46203db849e8d.png](/assets/resources-writeups/ffc31aaf84a002e4dee46203db849e8d.avif)
An analyst noticed some suspicious account activity on a workstation. We think the device may be compromised – can you look into this?

[log_chall.evtx](https://leveleffectcda.ctfd.io/files/1c5f28a4c20c7d14afa7a4a95b85746f/log_chall.evtx?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNTE0LCJ0ZWFtX2lkIjpudWxsLCJmaWxlX2lkIjozNX0.ZpP19w.y5J7aZCyHVNtSBfms9uM63IrqTM)

After opened this event log, we can see that there are a lot of EventID 4624 (	An account was successfully logged on)

We will have to find any suspicious Account Name on this event log to get a flag, because... well, a flag is in an Account Name as you can see
