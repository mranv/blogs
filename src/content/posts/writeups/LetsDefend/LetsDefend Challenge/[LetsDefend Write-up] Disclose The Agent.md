We reached the data of an agent leaking information. You have to disclose the agent.

## Start Investigation
We got a pcap file to work with so let's roll!

First thing I checked is the Protocol Hierarchy Statistics and there are a lot of SMTP packets were captured and there are some of Syslog, NetBIOS, SMB, and ARP Protocol as well.

SMTP conversation caught my eyes right away when I examined this pcap file, I saw login credential and some emails.

Follow the TCP stream we can see the message of the email.

Look like Ann wrote this email as we seen in From: `"Ann Dercover" <sneakyg33k@aol.com>`

And the recipient is `sec558@gmail.com`

She's talking about Lunch, let's find out if there is another email were captured

There it is an email from Ann to `mistersecretx@aol.com`

Look like they're planning to go to a date, so this mistersecretx is the Ann's secret boyfriend.

An attachment was also sent with this email.

I used NetworkMiner to extract the attachment
