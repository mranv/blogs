## Start Investigation
After downloaded both file, I started by parsing the eml file on Email Viewer and opened it on vscode at the same time

![a1d8c7d632e781e8590bd5a4ad52fa20.png](assets/resources-writeupsa1d8c7d632e781e8590bd5a4ad52fa20.png)

Online Email Reader works as a charm, this is what it should look like

Looking at the header it seems like the sender was not hide the actual email


Looking at the contents it says that there is an attachment came with it and the sender told the recipient to confirm it


![36d75b63ef17b9ce9ab28a2cd3c23ffd.png](assets/resources-writeups36d75b63ef17b9ce9ab28a2cd3c23ffd.png)

Since the sender IP address could be seen on the email header, I searched this IP for the location and this IP address located in the Vancouver from Canada. 

Now it's time to analyze the email attachment

Just at first gland, it's obviously a hugh red flag right there, it's not an image file or document file but an exe file

![8e0810c2b30bffcf6c84a9d8485b83b8.png](assets/resources-writeups8e0810c2b30bffcf6c84a9d8485b83b8.png)

![11b34a6e6e6b627c86e52b9e80163a58.png](assets/resources-writeups11b34a6e6e6b627c86e52b9e80163a58.png)

I threw it to pestudio and found that this file does 3 MITRE techniques

![57ab04d852fb2675eee7b8e36449704e.png](assets/resources-writeups57ab04d852fb2675eee7b8e36449704e.png)

Then I searched the hash on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9909753bfb0ac8ab165bab3555233d03b01a9274a92e57c022f87ccbe51ca415), Sure enough that this file is malicious and these vendors labels it as [Loki](https://success.trendmicro.com/dcx/s/solution/1117830-loki-malware-information?language=en_US) 

So our investigation concluded here
