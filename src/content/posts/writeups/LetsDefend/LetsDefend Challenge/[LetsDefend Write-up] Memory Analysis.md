**Memory Analysis**

A Windows Endpoint was recently compromised. Thanks to our cutting-edge EDR/IDS solution we immediately noticed it. The alert was escalated to Tier 2 (Incident Responders) for further investigation. As our Forensics guy, you were given the memory dump of the compromised host. You should continue to investigate.

NOTE: You can use the <u>[Volatility](https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/releases)</u> for analysis.

## Start Investigation
> What was the date and time when Memory from the compromised endpoint was acquired?

![608a223b2e61352f9b66673eae191a7f.png](assets/resources-writeups/608a223b2e61352f9b66673eae191a7f.png)
Volatility 2 didn't work well with this memory image (i tried) so I ended up with `vol3 -f dump.mem windows.info` to get SystemTime 
```
2022-07-26 18:16:32
```

> What was the suspicious process running on the system? (Format : name.extension)

I used `vol3 -f dump.mem windows.pstree` and this lsass process is suddenly caught my eyes because it couldn't be the chlid process of explorer.exe
```
lsass.exe
```


> Analyze and find the malicious tool running on the system by the attacker (Format name.extension)

![7f09404b80e33e0c91c6c3083ec0c273.png](assets/resources-writeups/7f09404b80e33e0c91c6c3083ec0c273.png)
Lets drump it with `vol3 -f dump.mem -o /tmp/outfile/  windows.pslist --pid 7592 --dump` then use `md5sum /tmp/outfile/pid.7592.0x2238edc0000.dmp` to calculate MD5 so we can use this hash to search on VirusTotal

It's [winPEAS](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS), so the attacker tried to gain system/admin privilege or enumerate system using this tool
```
winPEAS.exe
```

> Which User Account was compromised? Format (DomainName/USERNAME)

![6e46717375b7fd5ff9ed5a97f6fdfd1d.png](assets/resources-writeups/6e46717375b7fd5ff9ed5a97f6fdfd1d.png)
We will use `vol3 -f dump.mem windows.sessions` to determine if that suspicious process has a session under any username, which there is
```
MSEDGEWIN10/CyberJunkie
```

> What is the compromised user password?

![718f4f633da3f58129c6342e0d319807.png](assets/resources-writeups/718f4f633da3f58129c6342e0d319807.png)
I used hashdump plugin then filter for specific user and pipe it to a file with this `vol3 -f dump.mem hashdump | grep "Cyber" > CyberJunkie.hash`
![abef713f6b30c8e7eeef289e873175e4.png](assets/resources-writeups/abef713f6b30c8e7eeef289e873175e4.png)
Then I made a little adjustment before using john to crack it
![c8a6b981c23fed540fe24e1d8d685bfd.png](assets/resources-writeups/c8a6b981c23fed540fe24e1d8d685bfd.png)
Using `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt CyberJunkie.hash --format=NT` then we have his password
```
password123
```
