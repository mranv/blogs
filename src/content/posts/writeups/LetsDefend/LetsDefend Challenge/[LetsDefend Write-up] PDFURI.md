Our friend "Dee" was looking for a job in Tanta, but it seems she was hacked by one of the malicious websites, so can you examine her hard drive and find some evidence?

## Start Investigation

As soon as the machine is up, I extracted the 7zip file right away and Iook like I got an image to work with
![70dac945fe01d067b51ad66c6a068c33.png](assets/resources-writeups70dac945fe01d067b51ad66c6a068c33.png)

Next I opened FTK Imager and add an image as the evidence 
![98fa8391083b165f642e1fcb5bcceb5b.png](assets/resources-writeups98fa8391083b165f642e1fcb5bcceb5b.png)

After scrolling for a while, I found that there is a user `Work` that is not the default user and within the Downloads folder, there is a pdf document file there
![830a0c658303edef848bcb7aa786cb68.png](assets/resources-writeups830a0c658303edef848bcb7aa786cb68.png)
I exported both hash and file then loaded the file to PDFStreamDumper
![4298e8a8125baafe14c223b6fe2e5405.png](assets/resources-writeups4298e8a8125baafe14c223b6fe2e5405.png)
This is definitely a suspicious document or even malicious according to this challenge, It will run a powershell commands once it opened
![551c4088056a75e83eb27a93fc014fcd.png](assets/resources-writeups551c4088056a75e83eb27a93fc014fcd.png)
And After executing this command, a new registry entry with the name **s3cr3tF1o0w** and the specified value will be created under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment`.

Next I went on `\Users\Work\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data` to find Microsoft Edge Browser Artifacts and export them as mush as needed
![8630f16285452c10e46e080d0f6a2318.png](assets/resources-writeups8630f16285452c10e46e080d0f6a2318.png)

I opened them using DB Browser for SQLite

On `Login Data`, I've got an email on the user.

and it also could be found on `Web Data`
![cecdcd90d8986f6ba74465162748a61c.png](assets/resources-writeupscecdcd90d8986f6ba74465162748a61c.png)
On `History`, I found the domain that the malicious document was hosted
![6ca92cb1949334c2c4269848b311d124.png](assets/resources-writeups6ca92cb1949334c2c4269848b311d124.png)

And lastly to answer the final question, I went to find SAM registry hive then loaded to Registry Viewer
![cc42745ef0d791b86c7b467ec8622e56.png](assets/resources-writeupscc42745ef0d791b86c7b467ec8622e56.png)
Which I've found that there is no `Work` user anymore but instead `Sl3awy` were there so the user changed the username from `Work` to `Sl3awy`.
