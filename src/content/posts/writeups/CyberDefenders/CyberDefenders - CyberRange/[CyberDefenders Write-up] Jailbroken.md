## Questions
> Q1: What is the IOS version of this device?

![9254ee28bb7cc9087e5f694f9ceb754c.png](/assets/resources-writeups/9254ee28bb7cc9087e5f694f9ceb754c.png)

To make our life easier, we will have to use [iLEAPP](https://github.com/abrignoni/iLEAPP)(iOS Logs, Events, And Plists Parser) to grab some keys information for us

![f9968c4f1ee3de9d405dc713206e0d80.png](/assets/resources-writeups/f9968c4f1ee3de9d405dc713206e0d80.png)

Which including Device details of this device  

```
9.3.5
```

> Q2: Who is using the iPad? Include their first and last name. (Two words)

![0ff16009ef9009212c89bc27142e38b8.png](/assets/resources-writeups/0ff16009ef9009212c89bc27142e38b8.png)

On "Account Data", we can see the username that was used on this device which indicates user's first and last name 

![21d1c22a0598cced838a6d7279c05c2e.png](/assets/resources-writeups/21d1c22a0598cced838a6d7279c05c2e.png)

Then we can confirm this by open "Calendar List"

```

> Q3: When was the last time this device was 100% charged? Format: 01/01/2000 01:01:01 PM

![d04ce6be9c222383f97575971fd66480.png](/assets/resources-writeups/d04ce6be9c222383f97575971fd66480.png)

There are sevaral iOS forensics cheetsheet online that might be helpful for this investigation and from this [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@mpotisambo8/ios-forensics-cheat-sheet-a121c74ef42d) we can see that we can get an information about Battery Level from `CurrentPowerLog.PLSQL`

![175ff9a433f0f5d1c9d4ab9e2a8877d5.png](/assets/resources-writeups/175ff9a433f0f5d1c9d4ab9e2a8877d5.png)

Which could be located in `\Jailbroken\private\var\containers\Shared\SystemGroup\4212B332-3DD8-449B-81B8-DBB62BCD3423\Library\BatteryLife`

![8589103ac3ba2750908b7659c134ebb0.png](/assets/resources-writeups/8589103ac3ba2750908b7659c134ebb0.png)

After open this file with DB Browser for SQLite, go to `PLBatteryAgent_EventBackward_Battery` table then go to the last row which we will see that this is the last time this device was 100% charged but we will have to convert UNIX timestamp to UTC first

![1178348b485c78110dd5cd2d5a3d7fa4.png](/assets/resources-writeups/1178348b485c78110dd5cd2d5a3d7fa4.png)

We can easily do this by using https://www.epochconverter.com/

```

> Q4: What is the title of the webpage that was viewed the most? (Three words)

![2aa0087bdd3d508a9e12a49e41dd05ab.png](/assets/resources-writeups/2aa0087bdd3d508a9e12a49e41dd05ab.png)

From the same cheatsheet, we will have to find one of these files to determine which webpage was visited the most

![d22746f6be772a6102b9d56a9e5bc904.png](/assets/resources-writeups/d22746f6be772a6102b9d56a9e5bc904.png)

First, lets find history file with `Get-ChildItem -Path "Z:\CD_35-jailbroken\Jailbroken\private\var\mobile\Containers\Data\Application" -Recurse -Filter "History.db" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` then we can see that it was located in `\Jailbroken\private\var\mobile\Containers\Data\Application\FB1B2A1C-AC19-406F-BEEC-EC048BF504EA\Library\Safari` 

![d269c26ebf47a0e35b04b1e64fcca3b4.png](/assets/resources-writeups/d269c26ebf47a0e35b04b1e64fcca3b4.png)

Using DB Browser of SQLite to open this file and open `history_visits` table which we will see that this google search was visited the most

```

```

> Q5: What is the title of the first podcast that was downloaded?

![37d6f0ace9b04d31064142644a046ae4.png](/assets/resources-writeups/37d6f0ace9b04d31064142644a046ae4.png)

After some googling with "iOS podcast forensics", It landed me with https://salt4n6.com/tag/podcasts/ and now we know which file we are after 

![428c1a186dca1bdb58a0b6e3ce2761a3.png](/assets/resources-writeups/428c1a186dca1bdb58a0b6e3ce2761a3.png)

So lets use `Get-ChildItem -Path "Z:\CD_35-jailbroken\Jailbroken\private\var\" -Recurse -Filter "MTLibrary.sqlite" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` to find where this file is located and it returns with `\Jailbroken\private\var\mobile\Containers\Shared\AppGroup\80179E24-1812-4B5F-8063-AECFC3773A7A\Documents`

![7944a19d22ed1ab700662e593cb2b6b1.png](/assets/resources-writeups/7944a19d22ed1ab700662e593cb2b6b1.png)

Using DB Browser for SQLite, and go to `ZMTEPISODE` table and then we will see there is a column for download time which is `ZDOWNLOADDATE` so we can sort it to see how many podcasts were downloaded and when

We will eventually see that only 2 podcasts were downloaded and here is the timestamp of the first podcast that was downloaded

![1d4f5b35b5d1ec08cd1b333f63228aac.png](/assets/resources-writeups/1d4f5b35b5d1ec08cd1b333f63228aac.png)

Scroll right for the title of this podcast to obtain an answer

```
WHERE ARE WE?
```

> Q6: What is the name of the WiFi network this device connected to? (Two words)

![a8d81a04cd854c78f2d4cb9e03a45776.png](/assets/resources-writeups/a8d81a04cd854c78f2d4cb9e03a45776.png)

Back to iLEAPP report, go to "WIFI Connections" and here we can choose either of these reports to obtain this answer 

```
black lab
```

> Q7: What is the name of the skin/color scheme used for the game emulator? This should be a filename.

![5fa4e3555cb440d65784c02912adf5cc.png](/assets/resources-writeups/5fa4e3555cb440d65784c02912adf5cc.png)

From history file, we can see that user searched for iOs jailbreak through and then download gameboy emulator and 2 games after that and here we can see which game emulator that was downloaded

![c33d0fecfac440aadf3a57694c7db787.png](/assets/resources-writeups/c33d0fecfac440aadf3a57694c7db787.png)

Go to Application State DB report on iLEAPP to find installed location for this app

![1b4f395577a1647b4e433315d51b32c9.png](/assets/resources-writeups/1b4f395577a1647b4e433315d51b32c9.png)

We will have to dig a little bit of GBA4iOS skin and from this [tutorials](http://www.gba4iosapp.com/tutorials/), we can see that it has to be either `.gbaskin` or `.gbcskin`

![0d0e6f4afec1e62ebf35b7087a8bbd94.png](/assets/resources-writeups/0d0e6f4afec1e62ebf35b7087a8bbd94.png)

We got both here but the answer of this question is the one with `.gbaskin` extension

```
Default.gbaskin
```

> Q8: How long did the News App run in the background?

![7d200881a884559480e1a4bebd3db0e3.png](/assets/resources-writeups/7d200881a884559480e1a4bebd3db0e3.png)

We will have to go back to `CurrentPowerlog.PLSQL` file and then go to `PLAppTimeService_Aggregate_AppRunTime` which stores information about runtime of each applications including news

```
197.810275
```

> Q9: What was the first app download from AppStore? (Two words)

![8497f084a552a624c9151e20a862d0d7.png](/assets/resources-writeups/8497f084a552a624c9151e20a862d0d7.png)

Go back to "Apps - itunes Metadata" report from iLEAPP then we can see that there are 2 apps that were downloaded from AppStore, first is Cookie Run and second is Pokemon Quest

```
Cookie Run
```

> Q10: What app was used to jailbreak this device? 

![d601c625e8dc74bf4f79841672c933f9.png](/assets/resources-writeups/d601c625e8dc74bf4f79841672c933f9.png)

We will have to find jailbreak app for this iOS version and lucky for us that this [website](https://idevicecentral.com/jailbreak-tools/ios-jailbreak-tools/) already collects most of jailbreaking apps for each iOS version

![25cbf383715ed8ffbf383621c2918cc6.png](/assets/resources-writeups/25cbf383715ed8ffbf383621c2918cc6.png)

We have 3 candidates but as soon as I decompressed zip file to investigated, BitDefender already spolling me which one of them was installed on this device

![9432965059ca26a3393247242f5293ca.png](/assets/resources-writeups/9432965059ca26a3393247242f5293ca.png)

To solve this as it was intented, we will have to find it in "Application State DB" report in iLEAPP 

```
Phoenix
```

> Q11: How many applications were installed from the app store?

![acd47ddcc3cc2935ca0aaaf90b88273e.png](/assets/resources-writeups/acd47ddcc3cc2935ca0aaaf90b88273e.png)
```

> Q12: How many save states were made for the emulator game that was most recently obtained?

![423d32eb06e694781062be3853f0c2f6.png](/assets/resources-writeups/423d32eb06e694781062be3853f0c2f6.png)

We already know that there are 2 games that were downloaded and installed on this device

![198248127cfdd95cc64f4d801153e7d3.png](/assets/resources-writeups/198248127cfdd95cc64f4d801153e7d3.png)

We will have to use `Get-ChildItem -Path "Z:\CD_35-jailbroken\Jailbroken\private\var\" -Recurse -Filter "*.gba" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` to find where the location of them (`.gba` is a Game Boy Advance ROM file. It's an exact copy of a GBA video game) which will lead us to `\Jailbroken\private\var\mobile\Documents`

![734b5b44622784356e92731455823ded.png](/assets/resources-writeups/734b5b44622784356e92731455823ded.png)

Going inside this folder then we can see there is a `Save States` folder here and as we can expected that it should have both save states for both game 

![523b5e7f12c3d0f2e86fbea9a4b44673.png](/assets/resources-writeups/523b5e7f12c3d0f2e86fbea9a4b44673.png)

But each game and only 1 save state, we didn't have to account which game was installed last anymore

```
1
```

> Q13: What language is the user trying to learn?

![781c4936850715521c7b6c1b322612f1.png](/assets/resources-writeups/781c4936850715521c7b6c1b322612f1.png)

From the podcast artifact we investigated, we can see that user also listened to Duolingo podcasts 

![90bd34d68b67fd3a5c75aec955169e45.png](/assets/resources-writeups/90bd34d68b67fd3a5c75aec955169e45.png)

Put any of them inside language detection tool then we will come to the same conclusion

```
Spanish
```

> Q14: The user was reading a book in real life but used their IPad to record the page that they had left off on. What number was it?

![9f231e43a6264daf2149b2761ec3ce89.png](/assets/resources-writeups/9f231e43a6264daf2149b2761ec3ce89.png)

I did some googling for a folder that stores recording videos and this [reddit user generously](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/mm5qpz/apple_iphone_directory_accessibility/) telling us that we will have to go to `\private\var\mobile\Media\DKIM\10XAPPLE`

![9c1f3efb848f81ed53a0555508d7fb4b.png](/assets/resources-writeups/9c1f3efb848f81ed53a0555508d7fb4b.png)

Close enough, we have `100APPLE` folder that have 1 recording video inside

![5d49793a3d1f3b2121f2981a0b3c38b4.png](/assets/resources-writeups/5d49793a3d1f3b2121f2981a0b3c38b4.png)

User turned so many pages but eventually stopped at page 85 which is the answer of this question

```
85
```

> Q15: If you found me, what should I buy? 

I wanted to find all files that contains string "buy" but it took too long so I checked for hint which telling me that we need to find for any notes

![fa40e7c4e4535097d23384bd282d62ee.png](/assets/resources-writeups/fa40e7c4e4535097d23384bd282d62ee.png)

Lets find where note database is located with `Get-ChildItem -Path "Z:\CD_35-jailbroken\Jailbroken\private\var\" -Recurse -Filter "NoteStore.sqlite" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` which will lead us to `\Jailbroken\private\var\mobile\Containers\Shared\AppGroup\4466A521-8AF9-4E09-800B-C3203BB70E0E`

![4612fb5046e7bd22ed961c4d4d380f23.png](/assets/resources-writeups/4612fb5046e7bd22ed961c4d4d380f23.png)

For this artifact, we could not use DB Browser for SQLite to read notes but we will have to use [mac_apt](https://github.com/ydkhatri/mac_apt) with NOTES plugin like this `.\mac_apt_artifact_only.exe -i "Z:\CD_35-jailbroken\Jailbroken\private\var\mobile\Containers\Shared\AppGroup\4466A521-8AF9-4E09-800B-C3203BB70E0E\NoteStore.sqlite" -c NOTES -o "Z:\CD_35-jailbroken\"`

![d9609b75cdf995c932fb2b545a3788f4.png](/assets/resources-writeups/d9609b75cdf995c932fb2b545a3788f4.png)

Go to output folder and open `Notes.csv`, then we can see that "we" should buy Crash Bandicoot game for PS4

```
Crash Bandicoot Nitro-Fueled Racing
```

> Q16: There was an SMS app on this device's dock. Provide the name in bundle format: com.provider.appname

![07fbb1b96217dfeba6117784ace1c2aa.png](/assets/resources-writeups/07fbb1b96217dfeba6117784ace1c2aa.png)

Go to "Application State DB" report from iLEAPP then find for SMS app then we will eventually find the name in bundle format 

```
com.apple.MobileSMS
```

> Q17: A reminder was made to get something, what was it?

![1b08e05470008919431439b7a0037b65.png](/assets/resources-writeups/1b08e05470008919431439b7a0037b65.png)

There are two main things that people use for reminders: Notes and Calendar. However, we already parsed Notes and found nothing, and the "Calendar List" report did not give us anything either.

![f6b0981235a1de435562452b3fe66034.png](/assets/resources-writeups/f6b0981235a1de435562452b3fe66034.png)

We have to browse Calendar database directly which located in `\Jailbroken\private\var\mobile\Library\Calendar` and after open this database, go to `CalendarItem` then we will see 2 reminders here

```
