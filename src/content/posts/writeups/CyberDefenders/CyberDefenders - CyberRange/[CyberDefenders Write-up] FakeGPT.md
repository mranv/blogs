**Scenario:**
Your cybersecurity team has been alerted to suspicious activity on your organization's network. Several employees reported unusual behavior in their browsers after installing what they believed to be a helpful browser extension named "ChatGPT". However, strange things started happening: accounts were being compromised, and sensitive information appeared to be leaking.

Your task is to perform a thorough analysis of this extension identify its malicious components.

**Tools**:
- ExtAnalysis

## What we have
![2c6c6b9afd19f1b9437a861d3f3b94c3.png](/assets/resources-writeups/2c6c6b9afd19f1b9437a861d3f3b94c3.png)

Lets take a look at what we have here, we have 3 js, 1 html, 1 GIF and `manifest.json` file and since we already know that we have to perform an analysis of fake ChatGPT extension then lets start with `manifest.json` which contain metadata of this extension to understand more about this extension and its permission.

![aa88622dad0e87f85bb32206d681e392.png](/assets/resources-writeups/aa88622dad0e87f85bb32206d681e392.png)

- `manifest_version` telling us that this extension use Manifest V2 which is already deprecated since we are moving to Manifest V3
- `name` telling us the name of this extension
- `permissions` telling us that this extension can access information about browser tabs and interact with them in both HTTP and HTTPS websites. and it also stores and retrieve data locally (`storage`), intercept and modifying network requests including blocking or redirecting them (`webRequest` and `webRequestBlocking`) and lastly, it can access and manipulate browser cookies (`cookies`) 
- `background` telling us that `loaders.js` will be running persistently in the background 
- `content_scripts` telling us that `app.js` will be running on all web pages and interact with DOM of every website user visit.
- `browser_action` telling us that that when click for this extension, `ui.html` will be displayed to user.

Now lets hunt for each js scripts to understand more about this extension.

## Questions
>Q1:Which encoding method does the browser extension use to obscure target URLs, making them more difficult to detect during analysis?

![fd9a92f28b1583137f226ab1fe797816.png](/assets/resources-writeups/fd9a92f28b1583137f226ab1fe797816.png)

Then upon reading the `app.js`, which responsible for capturing keystroke and exfiltrate data and credential, encrypt then send them to C2

we can clearly see that there is 1 string with `==` padding indicates that it was encoded with base64. 

![e8111bd556e8d27aaec29003532c3409.png](/assets/resources-writeups/e8111bd556e8d27aaec29003532c3409.png)

So we can decode it which we can see that it is indeed base64 encoded and the site that was targeted by this extension is facebook.

```
base64
```

>Q2: Which website does the extension monitor for data theft, targeting user accounts to steal sensitive information?
```
www.facebook.com
```

>Q3: Which type of HTML element is utilized by the extension to send stolen data?

![b83520c6396ded56d7c27f43440fa57c.png](/assets/resources-writeups/b83520c6396ded56d7c27f43440fa57c.png)

Lets take a look at `sendToServer` function that responsible for sending encrypted data pass from `exfiltrateCredentials` to C2 server, we can see that an image element and the `src` attribute is set to C2 url then an encrypted data will be append to this url before adding the image element to the webpage

```
<img>
```

>Q4: What is the first specific condition in the code that triggers the extension to deactivate itself?

![756564428a58483f0987b402353fbdd7.png](/assets/resources-writeups/756564428a58483f0987b402353fbdd7.png)

For this one, we have to take a look at `loader.js` file which will check for installed browser plugin and `HeadlessChrome` user plugin which is common in VM so it will alert user with disable itself

This script also loads other additional scripts and core script `app.js` that we just analyzed in previous question.

```
navigator.plugins.length === 0
```

>Q5: Which event does the extension capture to track user input submitted through forms?

![ae7d161fc0d56cd7b6bf8abc264fee46.png](/assets/resources-writeups/ae7d161fc0d56cd7b6bf8abc264fee46.png)

Lets go back to `app.js`, we can see that it create Event Listener on `submit` element which will get `username`, `email` and `password` from a form and if both values exists then it will encrypted both values and send it to C2.

```
submit
```

>Q6: Which API or method does the extension use to capture and monitor user keystrokes?

![c61e52456d6c89edd9d1dee368dcbe38.png](/assets/resources-writeups/c61e52456d6c89edd9d1dee368dcbe38.png)

`keydown` event listener will also added to capture a keystroke with which will pass to `exfiltrateData` function to construct json payload before sending to C2.

```
keydown
```

>Q7: What is the domain where the extension transmits the exfiltrated data?

![fae190694e284ec273d721e24d0c32e9.png](/assets/resources-writeups/fae190694e284ec273d721e24d0c32e9.png)
```
Mo.Elshaheedy.com
```

>Q8: Which function in the code is used to exfiltrate user credentials, including the username and password?

![72d860fb30c3b3c15dcef92cf93949e3.png](/assets/resources-writeups/72d860fb30c3b3c15dcef92cf93949e3.png)
```
exfiltrateCredentials(username, password);
```

>Q9: Which encryption algorithm is applied to secure the data before sending?

![2e2e79dfb98208b999ebd78637f18c19.png](/assets/resources-writeups/2e2e79dfb98208b999ebd78637f18c19.png)

Lets take a look at `encryptPayload` function that responsible for data encryption, which we can see that its use AES with hard-coded key "SuperSecretKey123" with random IV to encrypt data then return iv and base64 encoded of encrypted data to a function that calls for this function.

```
AES
```

>Q10: What critical browser API does the extension use to access and manipulate cookies?

![a819ab93ec8a236c720c86b79e77a3b2.png](/assets/resources-writeups/a819ab93ec8a236c720c86b79e77a3b2.png)
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/cookies
```
chrome.cookies
```
