**Case Overview**:
Your bedroom door bursts open, shattering your pleasant dreams. Your mad scientist of a boss begins dragging you out of bed by the ankle. He simultaneously explains between belches that the FBI contacted him. They found his recently-developed Szechuan sauce recipe on the dark web. As you careen past the door frame you are able to grab your incident response “Go-Bag”. Inside is your trusty incident thumb drive and laptop.

## Questions
> Q1: What’s the Operating System version of the Server? (two words)

![15d9ca27f3e7c43e44bf2ec98fe2bcd8.png](assets/resources-writeups15d9ca27f3e7c43e44bf2ec98fe2bcd8.png)

We got plenty of artifacts here so its naturally come with different approach for each artifacts, first is to dump SOFTWARE registry hive and use Registry Explorer to read `/Microsoft/WindowsNT/CurrentVersion` subkey

![6bfff31a01c296732e66cbd343965e07.png](assets/resources-writeups6bfff31a01c296732e66cbd343965e07.png)

Which you can see that Domain Controller server is using Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard Edition

```
2012 R2
```

The other way to solve this challenge is to used volatility to query registry key from memory dump which I would not recommend doing that if we have disk image available

> Q2: What’s the Operating System of the Desktop? (four words separated by spaces)

![4f411b69b43dc38536af0a471813ab33.png](assets/resources-writeups4f411b69b43dc38536af0a471813ab33.png)

We will use the same approach here on Desktop's disk image to dump registry key and read `CurrentVersion` subkey

```
Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation
```

> Q3: What was the IP address assigned to the domain controller?

![50bef62bc6b0f92d17562bb1134c1d23.png](assets/resources-writeups50bef62bc6b0f92d17562bb1134c1d23.png)

This time, we will have to open SYSTEM registry hive and go to `ControlSet001\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\` and manually display content of each subkey which represent different network interface on the domain controller

```
10.42.85.10
```

> Q4: What was the timezone of the Server?

![1b2bebb6cf1863c99504aee8b16c3b9d.png](assets/resources-writeups1b2bebb6cf1863c99504aee8b16c3b9d.png)

Still on SYSTEM hive for this one but we have to find `ControlSet001\Control\TimeZoneInformation` subkey which we can see that it was set to Pacific Standard Time which is UTC-7 but it is not the right answer 

We have to correlated time that was captured on PCAP (which should be the most accurate one) and the time on Event Log (but we can not open it on our computer since all timestamp will be changed to the computer timezone that opened that log file)

![9811081436d3f3bb5b1571fc12927e87.png](assets/resources-writeups9811081436d3f3bb5b1571fc12927e87.png)

So the other way I could think of is to use EvtxCmd from EZ Tools and use Timeline Explorer to open it

![f5d36337bbbf204c8d7f5fb071b00c8d.png](assets/resources-writeupsf5d36337bbbf204c8d7f5fb071b00c8d.png)

Now we can see that the result from EvtxCmd and pcap file are different for an hour so its UTC-6 not UTC-7

```
UTC-6
```

> Q5: What was the initial entry vector (how did they get in)?. Provide protocol name.

![3f457256e2b8d500f656a3ea8e592faf.png](assets/resources-writeups3f457256e2b8d500f656a3ea8e592faf.png)

I exported some event log files and use [DeepBlueCLI](https://github.com/sans-blue-team/DeepBlueCLI) to find any thing suspicious which will landed us with multiple login failures for Administrator account so we could grasp that there was a bruteforce attack for Administrator account here

![329493bb2cfa27dad7c51fdb24251ef7.png](assets/resources-writeups329493bb2cfa27dad7c51fdb24251ef7.png)

We can use BrimSecurity with Suricata rules to correlated suspicious activities from pcap file for us which we can see that all those login failures happened on port 3389 which is RDP protocol

```
rdp
```

> Q6: What was the malicious process used by the malware? (one word)

![651b86167a33e97e5cda8878e4109b15.png](assets/resources-writeups651b86167a33e97e5cda8878e4109b15.png)

We will have to use volatility 3 for this one (its faster than volatility 2) but after tried once with `windows.netscan` plugin, there are a lot of `dns.exe` activities so I switched to `vol3 -f citadeldc01.mem windows.netscan > ip.txt && grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' ip.txt | sort | uniq` to pipe an output from `windows.netscan` to a text file then use grep with regex to filter out all an IP addresses from this text file

which we can see that there are 1 IP address that is not the domain controller so I think we have one

![ca31c2351780d1cee471953322d1aa2e.png](assets/resources-writeupsca31c2351780d1cee471953322d1aa2e.png)

When we searched this IP address on VirusTotal, we can see that its from Thailand and it was flagged as malicious by 5 different security vendors

![889ef2b8bf7f6245e1ff45d03f305e67.png](assets/resources-writeups889ef2b8bf7f6245e1ff45d03f305e67.png)

Go back to our text file to find a process responsible for this connection

```
coreupdater
```

> Q7: Which process did malware migrate to after the initial compromise? (one word)

![6947a08807946b8a31c0c04d0b9fe481.png](assets/resources-writeups6947a08807946b8a31c0c04d0b9fe481.png)

We will have to use `vol3 -f citadeldc01.mem windows.malfind` to find any process injection or process hollowing which are techniques used for persistence if the process that responsible for a connection was killed so the other process can still do the job

And we can see that `spoolsv.exe` was injected by looking at hexdump of this process (MZ - 4d 5a is the magic number of MS executable file)

![12f39f36186c87aad2982cbde961a0cf.png](assets/resources-writeups12f39f36186c87aad2982cbde961a0cf.png)

I tried to dump it with `vol3 -f citadeldc01.mem windows.malfind`, we can see that I got an error because of my anti-virus product monitoring this directory so if you did this on an system that does not monitored by Anti-Virus product and will not get any error 

![676c7bd77534cd1ad8256329ff61e656.png](assets/resources-writeups676c7bd77534cd1ad8256329ff61e656.png)

But we can see that from the process we dumped, it got detected and flagged as Metasploit shellcode so now we know that this is 99% meterpreter payload and it migrated to `spoolsv.exe`

![5b3a07e4e0441b5e8e0df82145edf402.png](assets/resources-writeups5b3a07e4e0441b5e8e0df82145edf402.png)

I copied memory dump and dumped it again and pretend that we did not know anything so we can get file hash and search it VirusTotal

![8fda5feee8b83831690414f0e48ec571.png](assets/resources-writeups8fda5feee8b83831690414f0e48ec571.png)

Now we can properly see it on VirusTotal

```
spoolsv
```

> Q8: Identify the IP Address that delivered the payload.

![7cdbbf64a8804fb5c7669511bdee5438.png](assets/resources-writeups7cdbbf64a8804fb5c7669511bdee5438.png)

find the `coreupdater.exe` on pcap file then we can see that it was hosted on this url

![203339be1dabc0cfbf1f50a057f4548b.png](assets/resources-writeups203339be1dabc0cfbf1f50a057f4548b.png)

This IP address is in Russia and get 1 total red flag on VirusTotal

```
194.61.24.102
```

> Q9: What IP Address was the malware calling to?

We already know an answer of this question from `windows.netscan` plugin
```
203.78.103.109
```

> Q10: Where did the malware reside on the disk?

![15d4727c0bee9e83d5898ec1d5dfded6.png](assets/resources-writeups15d4727c0bee9e83d5898ec1d5dfded6.png)

I got an answer of this question on autorunsc csv file of the domain controller, we can see that it was placed inside `\Windows\System32` folder

```
C:\Windows\System32\coreupdater.exe
```

> Q11: What's the name of the attack tool you think this malware belongs to? (one word)

![31a31cf458ad9ed2279fc39d8d5c58bc.png](assets/resources-writeups31a31cf458ad9ed2279fc39d8d5c58bc.png)

We already know this answer, there is other way to find this question and it is to find this alert in BrimSecurity

```
Metasploit
```

> Q12: One of the involved malicious IP's is based in Thailand. What was the IP? 
```
203.78.103.109
```

> Q13: Another malicious IP once resolved to klient-293.xyz . What is this IP?

![70e8d7d9f1c942e49543e48ed64c81bc.png](assets/resources-writeups70e8d7d9f1c942e49543e48ed64c81bc.png)

I did not find this on pcap file and host files so I went back to VirusTotal and go to Relations, we can see that this IP address once resolved to `klient-293.xyz`

```
194.61.24.102
```

> Q14: The attacker performed some lateral movements and accessed another system in the environment via RDP. What is the hostname of that system?

![0c88383dc319ae6986afa9aaeca7b35f.png](assets/resources-writeups0c88383dc319ae6986afa9aaeca7b35f.png)

We can get this answer by take a look at `ControlSet001\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName` subkey on SYSTEM registry hive

![9aee70d514818ea1ebb8fb7e49a505e6.png](assets/resources-writeups9aee70d514818ea1ebb8fb7e49a505e6.png)

Or we can go to Administrator's documents folder in the domain controller disk image to find `Default.rdp` which is a file created when open Remote Desktop program and it eventually 

```
DESKTOP-SDN1RPT
```

> Q15: Other than the administrator, which user has logged into the Desktop machine? (two words)

![d90ccb364badcd51f8520c1330339fe9.png](assets/resources-writeupsd90ccb364badcd51f8520c1330339fe9.png)

We can see that beside the administrator, there are other 2 user accounts and we need to confirm which one is the one that logged into this machine

![d2ed0b34662f9058f3208874874744fa.png](assets/resources-writeupsd2ed0b34662f9058f3208874874744fa.png)

Filter Event ID 4624 in `Security.evtx` then we will see only "ricksanchez" was successfully logged on and found no evidence of other user which mean other account did not log into this machine

```
Rick Sanchez
```

> Q16: What was the password for "jerrysmith" account?

![c5ccfe4d731cb3c8d9ecb01c5f734520.png](assets/resources-writeupsc5ccfe4d731cb3c8d9ecb01c5f734520.png)

I tried using `hashdump` plugin on volatility3 and it did not work so I came to export `ndts.dit` which is an AD database file used by Windows server and since we already exported SYSTEM registry hive then we can process with `secretdump.py` to dump all NTLM hashes from this file directly

![fdeb4e848059c9ee18c7a1fcbcbabfea.png](assets/resources-writeupsfdeb4e848059c9ee18c7a1fcbcbabfea.png)

We got the hive, we got the file so lets do it ! - `sudo python secretsdump.py -system /media/sf_c15-SzechuanSauce/output/DC/SYSTEM -ntds /media/sf_c15-SzechuanSauce/output/DC/ntds.dit LOCAL -outputfile /media/sf_c15-SzechuanSauce/output/DC/password.txt`

![33f08704de8ba34cbac365aa9b560fc9.png](assets/resources-writeups33f08704de8ba34cbac365aa9b560fc9.png)

Now since we already exported it to a file then we can proceed with `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt password.txt.ntds --format=NT` to get all password cracked

```
!BETHEYBOO12!
```

> Q17: What was the original filename for Beth’s secrets?

![3ac027583eb71e169df5e83248ce52b4.png](assets/resources-writeups3ac027583eb71e169df5e83248ce52b4.png)

Inside disk image of the domain controller, there is a file named `Beth_Secret.txt` inside of `\FileShare\Secret` folder but that is not the right answer

![908ee2937b56085f8f47e2b65e16729f.png](assets/resources-writeups908ee2937b56085f8f47e2b65e16729f.png)

I guessed it would be renamed so we could check for MFT file but I found another text file inside RecybleBin which is the original secret file that was deleted

```
Secret_beth.txt
```

> Q18: What was the content of Beth’s secret file? ( six words, spaces in between)

![2a3df80440f6b21393eba78b76f758f2.png](assets/resources-writeups2a3df80440f6b21393eba78b76f758f2.png)

```
Earth Beth is the real Beth
```

> Q19: The malware tried to obtain persistence in a similar way to how Carbanak malware obtains persistence. What is the corresponding MITRE technique ID?

![a58f99bb731a74521b26540f59050569.png](assets/resources-writeupsa58f99bb731a74521b26540f59050569.png)

After searching for this malware, we will come across [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0008/) website that already listed which MITRE technique ID this malware used for us and we just need to confirm it

![9f2f7fe9a44341e13d1a96dcab113856.png](assets/resources-writeups9f2f7fe9a44341e13d1a96dcab113856.png)

I happened to use Regripper on SYSTEM registry hive, we can see that `coreupdater` really made itself a service so we can confirm the technique that was used by this malware

```
T1543.003
```
