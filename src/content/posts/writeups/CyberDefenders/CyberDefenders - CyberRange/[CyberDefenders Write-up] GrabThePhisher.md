**Scenario**:
An attacker compromised a server and impersonated https://pancakeswap.finance/, a decentralized exchange native to BNB Chain, to host a phishing kit at https://apankewk.soup.xyz/mainpage.php. The attacker set it as an open directory with the file name "pankewk.zip". 

Provided the phishing kit, you as a soc analyst are requested to analyze it and do your threat intel homework.

> Q11: What is the full name of the Phish Actor?

Since it's a Telegram API then I started reading [documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#available-methods) to interact with this API
And I found this getChat method that can retrieve information about the user

So I used this command
`wget https://api.telegram.org/bot5457463144:AAG8t4k7e2ew3tTi0IBShcWbSia0Irvxm10/getChat?chat_id=5442785564` on the cmd and got the answer
