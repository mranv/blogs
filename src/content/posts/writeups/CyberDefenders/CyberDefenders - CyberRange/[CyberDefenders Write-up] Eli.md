## Questions
> Q1: The folder to store all your data in - How many files are in Eli's downloads directory?

![b98d789b71626f388d64ad6801eafa24.png](assets/resources-writeupsb98d789b71626f388d64ad6801eafa24.png)

I've never touched chromebook before so I didn't know how their data structure look like, so I did some google search and found that it should be Downloads folder somewhere under user folder

```
# Find all "Downloads" directories
$downloadsDirs = Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Directory -Filter *Downloads*

# Iterate over each "Downloads" directory and list its contents
foreach ($dir in $downloadsDirs) {
    Write-Output "Contents of directory: $($dir.FullName)"
    Get-ChildItem -Path $dir.FullName
    Write-Output ""
}
```

So I used this powershell script to recursively find all files inside all "Downloads" folders 

![3eb4c97c785b7dd332c16b7529f1a03f.png](assets/resources-writeups3eb4c97c785b7dd332c16b7529f1a03f.png)

Which we will see that under `\2021 CTF - Chromebook\decrypted\mount\user\Downloads` folder, there are 6 files while the rest of Downloads folders doesn't have anything inside of them

![bd2b8e8c73dfaaed8cd6f0447497f6c8.png](assets/resources-writeupsbd2b8e8c73dfaaed8cd6f0447497f6c8.png)

```

```

> Q2: Smile for the camera - What is the MD5 hash of the user's profile photo?

![d1a7294d516e1ba3b93421509edf9c59.png](assets/resources-writeupsd1a7294d516e1ba3b93421509edf9c59.png)

After determined user, directory then I found an avatar image inside `\2021 CTF - Chromebook\decrypted\mount\user\Accounts\Avatar Images` folder

```
5ddd4fe0041839deb0a4b0252002127b
```

> Q3: Road Trip! - What city was Eli's destination in?

![6fdb232dbdfe0a0b5c9d0b6ef1fd2134.png](assets/resources-writeups6fdb232dbdfe0a0b5c9d0b6ef1fd2134.png)

Inside user's Downloads folder, we can see an image taken from google maps 

![522a2046d076fa826faa4867bc590aa5.png](assets/resources-writeups522a2046d076fa826faa4867bc590aa5.png)

which indicates user was going to Chick-fill-a in Plattsburgh city

```
Plattsburgh
```

> Q4: Promise Me - How many promises does Wickr make?

![c4a3567868179db70070e393c7175b2f.png](assets/resources-writeupsc4a3567868179db70070e393c7175b2f.png)

There is a pdf file inside user's Downloads folder that writing about Customer Security Promises

![ce2e2dc4dbf164f1eaa0c400efaa4277.png](assets/resources-writeupsce2e2dc4dbf164f1eaa0c400efaa4277.png)

Open this file and scroll down for a bit then we can see there are 9 promises 

```

```

> Q5: Key-ty Cat - What are the last five characters of the key for the Tabby Cat extension?

![21625653e87138491c961f34ab8977ac.png](assets/resources-writeups21625653e87138491c961f34ab8977ac.png)

There are so much extensions inside user's Extensions folder

![59bc425d0795c6afbcd3b06d700cd4b5.png](assets/resources-writeups59bc425d0795c6afbcd3b06d700cd4b5.png)

So I used `Get-ChildItem -Path "Z:\2021 CTF - Chromebook\decrypted\mount\user\Extensions" -Recurse -File | Select-String -Pattern "Tabby Cat" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Path -Unique` to find all the file that has strings "Tabby Cat" which eventually gave us path to `manifest.json` of this extension

![9558723c4bb6a4563889d51688967008.png](assets/resources-writeups9558723c4bb6a4563889d51688967008.png)

![2cf14252f6545c450241ba89b3c240c4.png](assets/resources-writeups2cf14252f6545c450241ba89b3c240c4.png)

Lets open it and get the last five characters of the key to answer this question 

```

> Q6: Time to jam out - How many songs does Eli have downloaded?

![1684dc3c2ef3b48d1276c963bb0923a1.png](assets/resources-writeups1684dc3c2ef3b48d1276c963bb0923a1.png)

There is Music folder inside `\2021 CTF - Chromebook\decrypted\mount\user\MyFiles\`, which have 2 mp3 files inside of it

> Q7: Autofill, roll out - Which word was Autofilled the most?

![565cff5bfdf754d4a1355dd3f63b568d.png](assets/resources-writeups565cff5bfdf754d4a1355dd3f63b568d.png)

I used [cLEAPP](https://github.com/markmckinnon/cLeapp) (Chrome Logs Events and Protobuf Parser) which is a tool that can help us automated some process for a little bit 

![0d3b02538f532eb97595d8be89a522e2.png](assets/resources-writeups0d3b02538f532eb97595d8be89a522e2.png)

Go to Chromebook Autofill then you can see that email field was filled the most

Alternatively, you can use DBbrowser for SQLite to open `Web Data` sqlite database from user home folder

```
email
```

> Q8: Dress for success - What is this bird's image's logical size in bytes?

![28d266b89f2823ad3954d6aa98d2c518.png](assets/resources-writeups28d266b89f2823ad3954d6aa98d2c518.png)

If you remember little linux penguin inside download folder, then you can navigate there and display logical size of this image 

![19c7e75321aa0f385f525ef9ccbf98ba.png](assets/resources-writeups19c7e75321aa0f385f525ef9ccbf98ba.png)

by using [hindsight](https://github.com/obsidianforensics/hindsight), you will eventually get the answer by sorting most visit sites but  its not google doc 

```
protonmail.com
```

> Q10: Vroom Vroom, What is the name of the car-related theme?

![7aa08df51c646f4a70d3da132a4fbf74.png](assets/resources-writeups7aa08df51c646f4a70d3da132a4fbf74.png)

Go to Installed Extensions sheet and you will see there is only one extension that related to the car 

```
Lamborghini Cherry
```

> Q11: You got mail - How many emails were received from notification@service.tiktok.com?

![573f966f4ae70d94f79d9cb8aabd6904.png](assets/resources-writeups573f966f4ae70d94f79d9cb8aabd6904.png)

I searched for a file that contains the string "tiktok"  inside and the file that caught my eye and made me want to look into it first is `\2021 CTF - Takeout\Takeout\Mail\All mail Including Spam and Trash.mbox`

![a10899876b33ec64dac7173a4a969454.png](assets/resources-writeupsa10899876b33ec64dac7173a4a969454.png)

![11f5b8aedbbfdcfdb6523a3a861b39ee.png](assets/resources-writeups11f5b8aedbbfdcfdb6523a3a861b39ee.png)

We can use thunderbird to open this but to make things easier, I'll just open this file using VScode and filter for "From: "Tiktok" <notification@service.tiktok.com>""

```

> Q12: Hungry for directions - Where did the user request directions to on Mar 4, 2021, at 4:15:18 AM EDT

We know that user was going to Chick-fill-A but time doesn't add up so I searched for this specific time and found it was in `\2021 CTF - Takeout\Takeout\My Activity\Maps\MyActivity.html`

![f18018d0fec99409cda43ff7d2e12d9d.png](assets/resources-writeupsf18018d0fec99409cda43ff7d2e12d9d.png)

After researching what is Takeout folder, now it make sense why we found this information here

```

> Q14: I got three subscribers, and counting - How many YouTube channels is the user subscribed to?

![e9181af532bfd3a99b7db517679bf337.png](assets/resources-writeupse9181af532bfd3a99b7db517679bf337.png)

There is a `subscriptions.json` inside `\2021 CTF - Takeout\Takeout\YouTube and YouTube Music\` folder

![d2b2f67adedb644fd18d05ef4e2eef67.png](assets/resources-writeupsd2b2f67adedb644fd18d05ef4e2eef67.png)

There is no data inside of it which mean this user does not subscribe to anyone on youtube

```
0
```

> Q15: Time flies when you're watching YT - What date was the first YouTube video the user watched uploaded?

![a04826aad67b3563faa059e3556a11e7.png](assets/resources-writeupsa04826aad67b3563faa059e3556a11e7.png)

Scroll down to the last record which is the oldest one/first one that was recorded, follow this link then you will find the first youtube video that user watched 

![fdefb53e6aaed15051dbae3409a834c9.png](assets/resources-writeupsfdefb53e6aaed15051dbae3409a834c9.png)

> Q16: How much? - What is the price of the belt?

![62b2d5bd30c19858e3f4dd9cf7ad529a.png](assets/resources-writeups62b2d5bd30c19858e3f4dd9cf7ad529a.png)

Result from searching for a "belt" string lead us to Chrome browsing history 

![98b4789aac6832c77990ac5f75ad0994.png](assets/resources-writeups98b4789aac6832c77990ac5f75ad0994.png)

We can see that user accessed a shop for leather belt

![d592e221cd5ac3d4013471a4d78ffee4.png](assets/resources-writeupsd592e221cd5ac3d4013471a4d78ffee4.png)

But it is out of stock and the price could not be find anymore 

![30b032077037381c6ac0e317c78c4071.png](assets/resources-writeups30b032077037381c6ac0e317c78c4071.png)

I couldn't search for this belt on web archive too

![fd8095865318a4adb58b4cc93f9fd3fb.png](assets/resources-writeupsfd8095865318a4adb58b4cc93f9fd3fb.png)

Inspecting web page does not give me anything either

So I had to read other write-up for this one and turn out that I was using the right url on wayback machine and the url that was archive is https://web.archive.org/web/20210122000112/https://www.vineyardvines.com/mens-belts/pebbled-leather-belt/1B001191.html?dwvar_1B001191_color=202&cgid=mens-accessories
