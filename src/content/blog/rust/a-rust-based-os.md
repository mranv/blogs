# Building a Rust-Based Operating System: Theseus

Welcome to the world of Theseus â€“ a new operating system written entirely in Rust. This project is not just another attempt at building an OS; it's an exploration of novel OS structures, state management techniques, and how to leverage the design principles embedded within Rust itself. Strap in as we delve into the depths of Theseus and its fascinating journey towards reshaping the landscape of operating systems.

## The Vision

Theseus doesn't just aim to be another run-of-the-mill OS. Instead, it sets its sights on revolutionizing the way we conceive and construct operating systems. By pushing the boundaries of what's possible with modern programming languages, Theseus seeks to bridge the gap between compiler and hardware, maximizing the benefits of language safety and affine types. The result? A more secure, efficient, and adaptable operating system tailored for the demands of contemporary computing environments.

## Getting Started

If you're intrigued by Theseus and itching to get your hands dirty, fret not! We've made diving into the world of Theseus as seamless as possible. Here's a quick guide to help you get started:

1. **Cloning the Repository**: Start by cloning the Theseus repository to your local machine. This will give you access to all the source code and resources you need to begin your journey.

   ```
   git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus.git
   ```

2. **Installing Rust**: Rust is the lifeblood of Theseus. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system by following the setup instructions provided [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

3. **Building Theseus**: Once Rust is set up, navigate to the project directory and build Theseus using Cargo, Rust's package manager.

   ```
   cd Theseus
   make run
   ```

4. **Exploring Theseus**: With Theseus up and running, feel free to explore its features, tweak its code, and embark on your own OS development adventures.

## Supported Platforms

Theseus is designed to be versatile, supporting a range of platforms to accommodate diverse development environments. Whether you're running Linux, Windows, macOS, or even Docker, Theseus has got you covered.

## Contribution and Feedback

Theseus is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from enthusiasts, developers, and anyone else interested in reshaping the future of operating systems. Whether it's through code contributions, bug reports, or feature suggestions, your input is invaluable in helping Theseus evolve and thrive.

## Conclusion

Join us on this exhilarating journey as we push the boundaries of OS design and redefine the status quo. With Theseus, the possibilities are limitless, and the future of operating systems is within reach.
