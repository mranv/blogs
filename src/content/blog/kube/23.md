Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a crucial aspect of Kubernetes security. In this hands-on guide, we'll walk through the process of setting up RBAC, creating roles and role bindings, and testing user permissions in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` configured with admin access
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts

## Step 1: Setting Up a User

First, let's create a new user named 'krishna':

```bash
openssl genrsa -out krishna.key 2048
openssl req -new -key krishna.key -out krishna.csr -subj "/CN=krishna"
```

Now, create a CertificateSigningRequest and approve it:

```bash
# Create CSR
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
kind: CertificateSigningRequest
metadata:
  name: krishna-csr
spec:
  request: $(cat krishna.csr | base64 | tr -d '\n')
  signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
  expirationSeconds: 86400  # one day
  usages:
  - client auth
EOF

# Approve CSR
kubectl certificate approve krishna-csr

# Get the certificate
kubectl get csr krishna-csr -o jsonpath='{.status.certificate}'| base64 -d > krishna.crt
```

## Step 2: Checking Default Permissions

Switch to the krishna context:

```bash
kubectl config set-credentials krishna --client-key=krishna.key --client-certificate=krishna.crt
kubectl config set-context krishna-context --cluster=your-cluster-name --user=krishna
kubectl config use-context krishna-context
```

Now, try to create a pod:

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
```

You should see an error message indicating that krishna doesn't have permission to create pods.

## Step 3: Creating a Role

Switch back to the admin context:

```bash
kubectl config use-context admin-context
```

Create a Role for reading pods:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

Apply this Role:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod-reader-role.yaml
```

## Step 4: Creating a RoleBinding

Create a RoleBinding to associate the Role with krishna:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: krishna
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Apply this RoleBinding:

```bash
kubectl apply -f read-pods-rolebinding.yaml
```

## Step 5: Testing Permissions

Switch back to krishna's context:

```bash
kubectl config use-context krishna-context
```

Now, try these operations:

1. Create a pod:

   ```bash
   kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
   ```

   Expected: Permission denied

2. List pods:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   Expected: Success

3. Create a deployment:
   ```bash
   kubectl create deployment nginx-deploy --image=nginx
   ```
   Expected: Permission denied

## Conclusion

In this hands-on guide, we've walked through the process of implementing RBAC in Kubernetes. We created a new user, defined a Role with specific permissions, bound that Role to our user, and tested the resulting access controls.

Key takeaways:

1. RBAC allows fine-grained control over what users can do in a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Roles define permissions, while RoleBindings associate those permissions with users.
3. Always follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions.

Remember, RBAC is a powerful tool for securing your Kubernetes cluster. Use it wisely to ensure that users and services have only the permissions they need to function.
