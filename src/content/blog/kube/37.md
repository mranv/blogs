# Mastering Kubernetes Application Troubleshooting: A CKA Exam Perspective

Application troubleshooting is a crucial skill for any Kubernetes administrator, especially for those preparing for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of identifying and resolving issues in a sample voting application deployed on Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` configured to communicate with your cluster
- Git installed on your local machine

## Setting Up the Sample Application

Let's start by deploying our sample voting application:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piyushsachdeva/example-voting-app
   cd example-voting-app
   ```

2. Deploy the application:
   ```bash
   kubectl create -f k8s-specifications/
   ```

## Troubleshooting Process

Now that we've deployed our application with intentional errors, let's go through the troubleshooting process step by step.

### Step 1: Check Pod Status

First, let's check the status of all pods in our application:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Look for pods that are not in the "Running" state. Common issues you might see:

- Pending
- CrashLoopBackOff
- Error
- ImagePullBackOff

### Step 2: Investigate Pod Details

For pods that aren't running correctly, use the `describe` command to get more information:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

Pay attention to:

- Events section for error messages
- Container statuses
- Restart counts

### Step 3: Check Logs

For pods that are running but potentially misbehaving, check the logs:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

For multi-container pods, specify the container:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>
```

### Step 4: Verify Service Configuration

Ensure services are correctly configured:

```bash
kubectl get svc
kubectl describe svc <service-name>
```

Check:

- Correct port mappings
- Proper selector labels

### Step 5: Check ConfigMaps and Secrets

If the application uses ConfigMaps or Secrets, verify they exist and contain the correct data:

```bash
kubectl get configmaps
kubectl get secrets
kubectl describe configmap <configmap-name>
```

### Step 6: Verify Network Policies

If network policies are in use, ensure they're not blocking necessary traffic:

```bash
kubectl get networkpolicies
kubectl describe networkpolicy <policy-name>
```

### Step 7: Check Resource Constraints

Ensure pods have sufficient resources:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> | grep -A 3 Requests
```

### Step 8: Verify PersistentVolumeClaims

If the application uses persistent storage, check PVC status:

```bash
kubectl get pvc
kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name>
```

### Step 9: Analyze Application Logs

For application-specific issues, you may need to exec into the pod and check application logs:

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh
# Then navigate to and view relevant log files
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **ImagePullBackOff**:

   - Check image name and tag
   - Verify container registry credentials

2. **CrashLoopBackOff**:

   - Check application logs
   - Verify environment variables and configurations

3. **Pending Pods**:

   - Check node resources
   - Verify PersistentVolumeClaim bindings

4. **Service Discovery Issues**:

   - Verify service selectors match pod labels
   - Check DNS configuration

5. **Permission Issues**:
   - Verify RBAC settings
   - Check ServiceAccount configurations

## Key Takeaways for CKA Exam

1. **Systematic Approach**: Follow a structured troubleshooting process.

2. **Command Mastery**: Be proficient with `kubectl` commands, especially `get`, `describe`, and `logs`.

3. **Resource Understanding**: Know how different Kubernetes resources interact (Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.).

4. **Log Analysis**: Be able to quickly interpret logs and error messages.

5. **Networking Knowledge**: Understand Kubernetes networking principles, including Services and NetworkPolicies.

6. **Storage Concepts**: Be familiar with PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims.

7. **Application Awareness**: Recognize common application deployment patterns and their potential issues.

8. **Time Management**: Practice quick issue identification and resolution.

## Conclusion

Troubleshooting Kubernetes applications requires a combination of systematic approach, deep understanding of Kubernetes concepts, and familiarity with common issues. By following this guide and practicing with various scenarios, you'll be well-prepared for the application troubleshooting aspects of the CKA exam.

Remember, the key to effective troubleshooting is not just fixing the immediate issue, but understanding the root cause and preventing similar problems in the future. As you practice, focus on building a mental model of how different Kubernetes components interact and how issues in one area can manifest in others.

Keep honing your skills by deliberately introducing and resolving issues in test environments. This practical experience will be invaluable not just for the CKA exam, but for your career as a Kubernetes administrator.
