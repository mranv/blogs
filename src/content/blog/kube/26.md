---

Network policies are a crucial aspect of Kubernetes security, allowing fine-grained control over pod-to-pod communication. In this hands-on guide, we'll walk through setting up a Kind cluster with Calico, deploying applications, and implementing network policies.

## Step 1: Creating a Kind Cluster with Custom Networking

First, let's create a Kind cluster with the default CNI disabled:

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
    extraPortMappings:
      - containerPort: 30001
        hostPort: 30001
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
networking:
  disableDefaultCNI: true
  podSubnet: 192.168.0.0/16
```

Save this as `kind-config.yaml` and create the cluster:

```bash
kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml
```

## Step 2: Installing Calico

Follow the official Calico documentation to install it on your Kind cluster:

```bash
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.25.0/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.25.0/manifests/custom-resources.yaml
```

## Step 3: Deploying Applications

Let's create deployments for frontend, backend, and db:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: db
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: db
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: db
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:5.7
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3306
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: password
```

Save this as `deployments.yaml` and apply:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployments.yaml
```

## Step 4: Exposing Services

Now, let's expose these deployments as NodePort services:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: frontend
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30001
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30002
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: db
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: db
  ports:
    - port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
      nodePort: 30003
```

Save this as `services.yaml` and apply:

```bash
kubectl apply -f services.yaml
```

## Step 5: Testing Connectivity

To test connectivity, you can use temporary pods:

```bash
kubectl run tmp-shell --rm -i --tty --image nicolaka/netshoot -- /bin/bash
```

From within this pod, you can use `curl` to test connections to other services.

## Step 6: Implementing Network Policy

Now, let's create a network policy that only allows the backend to access the db:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-access-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: db
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: backend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 3306
```

Save this as `network-policy.yaml` and apply:

```bash
kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **CNI Flexibility**: Kind allows us to disable the default CNI and use alternatives like Calico.
2. **Fine-grained Control**: Network policies enable precise control over pod-to-pod communication.
3. **Label-based Selectors**: Network policies use labels to select pods, making them flexible and powerful.
4. **Default Deny**: Without explicit allow rules, network policies default to denying all traffic.
5. **Testing is Crucial**: Always test your network policies thoroughly to ensure desired behavior.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes Network Policies provide a powerful tool for securing your cluster's internal communications. By following this guide, you've set up a Kind cluster with Calico, deployed applications, and implemented a basic network policy. This foundation will allow you to create more complex policies tailored to your specific security needs.

Remember, network security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your policies as your application architecture evolves.
