# Rust System Log (Unix & Like-Unix)

In this blog post, we'll explore a simple Rust program that demonstrates how to log a message to the system log on a Linux-based system using the syslog crate.

## Prerequisites

Before running this program, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Rust toolchain (including Cargo)
- Systemd or another syslog daemon (such as rsyslog or syslog-ng)

## Building the Program

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
   ```bash
   cd sysunixlog
   ```
3. Build the program using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Running the Program

After successfully building the program, execute it using:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

or run the binary directly:

```bash
./target/release/sysunixlog
```

## Checking the System Log

### For systemd users:

Use the `journalctl` command to view logs managed by systemd. To filter logs from your program, you can use:

```bash
journalctl | grep myprogram
```

Replace "myprogram" with the name specified in your Rust code.

### For traditional syslog users:

Use the `tail` command to view the syslog file. For example:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep myprogram
```

Replace "myprogram" with the name specified in your Rust code.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that the syslog service is running on your system.
- Check permissions if you encounter issues with logging to the system log.
- If you encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue in this repository for assistance.

Now, let's take a look at the Rust code:

```rust
extern crate syslog;

use syslog::{Facility, Formatter3164};

fn main() {
    // Initialize the logger
    let formatter = Formatter3164 {
        facility: Facility::LOG_USER,
        hostname: None,
        process: "sysunixlog".into(),
        pid: 0,
    };

    match syslog::unix(formatter) {
        Err(e) => println!("impossible to connect to syslog: {}", e),
        Ok(mut writer) => {
            // Log the message
            writer.err("Genesis of Generic Germination U0001F49A, Anubhav!").expect("could not write error message");
        }
    }
}
```

And there you have it! With just a few simple steps, you can log messages to the system log in Rust. Happy logging! ðŸš€
