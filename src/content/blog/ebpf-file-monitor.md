# Linux based File Monitoring using eBPF

Keep an eagle-eye on your files with **ebpf-file-monitor**, a slick Rust program powered by cutting-edge eBPF technology. This utility alerts you instantly whenever changes occur in your files, ensuring you're always in the loop.

## Features

- **eBPF Technology**: Utilizes the latest eBPF advancements to trace file events efficiently.
- **Instant Alerts**: Prints out a timestamp the moment your file is modified, ensuring real-time awareness.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across Linux, Windows, and MacOS environments.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Rust 1.56+ (get the latest version)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)
- libbpf and bcc libraries (eBPF's dynamic duo)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mranv/ebpf-file-monitor.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd ebpf-file-monitor

# Install bcc and libbpf if needed
# For Fedora/RedHat:
sudo yum install bcc bpf
# For Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install libbpf-dev libbcc-dev

# Build the project
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Update the `FILE_PATH` variable in the source code to the file you want to monitor. Then, unleash the watchdog:

```bash
./target/release/ebpf-file-monitor
```

Now, sit back and relax as it prints timestamps whenever changes occur in the specified file.

## Implementation

- **libbpf**: Utilizes libbpf to load eBPF programs that trace open and write syscalls.
- **Event Filtering**: Filters for events related to the target file.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Prints timestamps upon modification events, ensuring immediate awareness.

## Limitations

- **Single File Monitoring**: Watches only one file at a time.
- **Dependency Requirements**: Requires eBPF/bcc libraries to be installed.

## Contributions

Got ideas to enhance this utility? Contributions are welcome! Feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions to make this watchdog even better.

## About

This utility is designed to track changes in specified files and provide instant timestamps upon modifications.
